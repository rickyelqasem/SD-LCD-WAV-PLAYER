# SD-LCD-WAV-PLAYER
Arduino WAV Player with SD and LCD functions
Testing App for Arduino Mega. Works but Audio is poor on a Mega without Audio Sheild.
The idea is to have the Arduino query the SD for wav files and display the filenames (one at a time) on a 16x2 LCD.
3 buttons are used. 1 plays the wav, 1 moves forward through the list and 1 moves backwards through the list
